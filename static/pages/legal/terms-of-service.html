            <p>WHILE VOICEGUARDAI STRIVES TO PROVIDE ACCURATE SCAM DETECTION, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT ALL SCAMS WILL BE DETECTED OR THAT LEGITIMATE CALLS WILL NEVER BE FLAGGED AS POTENTIAL SCAMS. THE SERVICE REQUIRES USER INITIATION OF VOICE SCANS AND PROPER SPEAKERPHONE USAGE TO FUNCTION CORRECTLY. THE SERVICE IS A TOOL TO ASSIST YOU, BUT YOU SHOULD ALWAYS EXERCISE YOUR OWN JUDGMENT WHEN DEALING WITH UNKNOWN CALLERS.</p>
            
            <h2 id="limitation-liability">9. Limitation of Liability</h2>

            </ul>
            <p>WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>
            <p>IN NO EVENT WILL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID US IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS OR, IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID US, $100.</p>
            <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHICH MEANS THAT SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, VOICEGUARDAI'S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
            
            <h2 id="indemnification">10. Indemnification</h2>

            <p>This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms and your use of the Service.</p>
            
            <h2 id="termination">11. Termination</h2>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.</p>

            <h3>13.3 Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <p>YOU AND VOICEGUARDAI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
